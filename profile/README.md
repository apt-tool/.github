# :fire: PTaaS

Welcome to __PTaaS (short form of Penetration Testing as a Service)__ official organization.
PTaaS is a service for performing automated penetration testings. It is a network security application that
reduces costs of a penetration testing. Also, it provides more observability over the testing process.

Our goal is to reduce penetration testing costs in a cloud environment. Also, we are looking forward to increase
the process velocity and reduce the human errors.

## about the project members

PTaaS is designend and implemented by students of Computer Engineering and Computer Science departments at __Amirkabir University of Technology__.
